  <h1 id="event">The event</h1>

  <p>Hack Day Paris is a <strong>40-hour marathon</strong> of hyper-intensive research and development followed by a lighting round of presentations and demos. The result is the exchange of ideas, community, & invention not realized during the normal pace of work and play.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>
  <p>The event will take place at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=3463729434493576879">La Ruche</a> in the <strong>10th Arrondissement</strong> of Paris starting on the evening of <strong>Friday, November 4, 2011</strong> where self-organized teams will begin their projects and the competition. Development will continue through 2 nights until noon on Sunday when the demos begin next door at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=12240490954719121951">Le Comptoir General</a> and our carefully selected panel of hackers, designers, and entrepreneurs will judge winners in various categories, including the overall ultimate hack. Anything goes as long as it is created during the competition and can be presented onsite on Sunday!</p>

<h2>Participate</h2>
  <p>Entry for the weekend is €10 and includes food, drink, and snacks throughout the competition. The facility, La Ruche, will be open during the entire event for hacking, letting loose, and (if you need it) sleeping. Admittance is strictly limited to participants so that we can accommodate as many projects as possible. There are no special requirements (coders, designers, clothiers, boulangers - indeed, we'd love to see some edible hacks!), only that you come to create and build something new. If you are member of the press/media, you can <a href="mailto:contact@hackdayparis.org">contact us</a> separately for entry into the final judging session or restricted visits during the competition.
