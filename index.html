<p>Hack Day Paris is a <strong>40-hour marathon</strong> of hyper-intensive research and development followed by a lighting round of presentations and demos. The result is the exchange of ideas, community, and invention not realized during the normal pace of work and play.</p>

<p class="tagline"><strong>Join us, build something brilliant, win €1500.</strong></p>
</section>


<section id="theevent">
<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>The event will take place at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=3463729434493576879">La Ruche</a> in the <strong>10th Arrondissement</strong> of Paris starting on the evening of <strong>Friday, November 4, 2011</strong> where self-organized teams will begin their projects and the competition. Development will continue through 2 nights until noon on Sunday when the demos begin next door at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=12240490954719121951">Le Comptoir General</a> and our carefully selected panel of hackers, designers, and entrepreneurs will judge winners in various categories, including the overall ultimate hack. Anything goes as long as it is created during the competition and can be presented onsite on Sunday!</p>

<p>Entry for the weekend is €10 and includes food, drink, and snacks throughout the competition. The facility, La Ruche, will be open during the entire event for hacking, letting loose, and (if you need it) sleeping. Admittance is strictly limited to participants so that we can accommodate as many projects as possible. There are no special requirements (coders, designers, clothiers, boulangers - indeed, we'd love to see some edible hacks!), only that you come to create and build something new. If you are member of the press/media, you can <a href="mailto:contact@hackdayparis.org">contact us</a> separately for entry into the final judging session or restricted visits during the competition.</p>

<section id="what">
<h2>What is Hack?</h2>

<div class="dictionary">
<span class="word">hack</span> <span class="phonetique">|hak|</span>
<span class="partofspeech">verb</span>
<span class="structure">[ with obj. ]</span> <span class="definition">to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes</span>
</div>

<p>The original English meaning of the word "hack" reflected an urgency in creating something - minimal, crude, but clever - to solve a problem of the moment. Somewhere along the way we lost this meaning, perhaps to the media and to Hollywood, who hijacked it to glamorize the way criminals and pirates created similarly fashioned software tools for personal benefit, often at the expense of others. At Hack Day Paris we reclaim the original meaning as makers, coders and inventors come together to build something new, ruthless and brilliant.</p>

<h4>Past Inspiring Events</h4>

<p>Hack Day Paris may well be the first of its kind in the French capital, but it is inspired by a long history of events around the world and locally. Check out some of these event which have shaped our vision for this event…</p>
